# Scale-Adaptive Feature Aggregation for Efficient Space-Time Video Super-Resolution
## Introduction
This project is the implement of [Scale-Adaptive Feature Aggregation for Efficient Space-Time Video Super-Resolution](). This project is still under construction. Some insights on multi-scale processing and feature fusion are reflected in RIFE applications, see [Practical-RIFE](https://github.com/hzwer/Practical-RIFE). Our SAFA network outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods such as TMNet and VideoINR by an average improve- ment of over 0.5dB on PSNR, while requiring less than half the number of parameters and only 1/3 computational costs. -> [author website](https://github.com/hzwer)
